This Python script serves as a currency converter and inflector for currency names on the Telegram platform. It consists of two main classes:

1. **CryptoConverter:**
   - The `get_price` method takes three parameters: `quote` (currency to convert), `base` (target currency), and `amount` (amount to convert). It makes an API request to Cryptocompare to obtain the conversion rate and calculates the total converted amount.
   - It handles exceptions such as identical currencies, unknown currencies, and invalid input values.

2. **DeclensionByCases:**
   - This class is designed to inflect (change the form of a word according to numerical cases) currency names.
   - The `incline` method takes a word (currency name) and a number, returning the correct word form according to the rules of the Russian language.

The script is structured to handle API exceptions, input validation, and precise currency conversion. Additionally, the inflection class helps create grammatically correct phrases when displaying amounts with currencies.

It is designed to be deployed on the Telegram platform, allowing users to convert currencies and receive grammatically correct responses. The script also provides helpful commands for users to understand its capabilities.
