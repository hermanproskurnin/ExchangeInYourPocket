This Python script provides functionality for cryptocurrency conversion and inflection of currency names. It includes two classes:

1. **CryptoConverter:**
   - The `get_price` method takes three parameters: `quote` (currency to convert), `base` (currency to convert into), and `amount` (amount to convert). It makes a request to the Cryptocompare API to get the conversion rate and calculates the total converted amount.
   - Exceptions are handled, such as identical currencies, unknown currencies, and invalid input values.

2. **DeclensionByCases:**
   - This class is designed for inflection (changing the word form depending on numeric cases) of currency names.
   - The `incline` method takes a word (currency name) and a number, returning the correct word form according to the rules of Russian grammar.

The script is structured to handle API exceptions, validate input values, and perform accurate currency conversion. Additionally, the inflection class helps create grammatically correct phrases when displaying amounts with currencies.
